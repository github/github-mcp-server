# Quick Reference: V4 Dividend Rotation - One-Page Execution Summary

## STRATEGY AT A GLANCE

**Approach**: Capture dividends from high-yield ETFs with minimal holding periods (3-5 days)

**Capital**: $50,000 | **Time**: Continuous rolling cycles | **Target Return**: 1-3% monthly (12-36% annualized)

## EXECUTION CALENDAR (NEXT 90 DAYS)

### Immediately Actionable (This Month):
- [ ] **NOBL.US**: Ex-Date Dec 10 → Buy Dec 8, Sell Dec 11 ($0.58/share)
- [ ] Monitor for any earlier available opportunities with past ex-dates

### Upcoming Cycles:
- Every 7-10 days, one of the 3 ETFs pays dividends
- 16 dividend events identified over next 90 days
- Provides consistent entry points for capital deployment

---

## DAILY WORKFLOW

### 3 Days Before Ex-Date
1. Identify upcoming ex-date from dividend calendar
2. Calculate shares to purchase: `(Available Cash × 0.33) / Current Price`
3. Set buy order for 2 days before ex-date

### On Buy Day
- Execute buy order at market open
- Confirm shares received
- Set calendar reminder for sell date

### Day After Ex-Date (Sell Day)
- Execute sell order at market open (target: +0.5% to +1.0%)
- Confirm proceeds
- Wait 2-3 days for dividend to settle
- Recycle capital to next opportunity

### Calculate Profit
```
Profit = (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Shares + Dividend Income
Example: ($43.10 - $42.50) × 200 + $64 = $184 per $8,500 deployed = 2.2%
```

---

## POSITION SIZING FORMULA

```
Capital Allocation = Total Cash × 0.33 (per event)
Shares to Buy = Allocation / Current Market Price
Max Position Size = $10,000 per trade
Min Position Size = $500 per trade
```

**Example with $50,000:**
- Allocation per event: $50,000 × 0.33 = $16,500
- Split across 3 ETFs: $5,500 each
- At $42/share (XYLD): Buy ~131 shares
- At $0.32 dividend: Earn $41.92 + ~$65 capital gain = $107 per position

---

## MONTHLY EXPECTATIONS

### Conservative Case
- 2-3 cycles per month
- $0.35-0.45 avg dividend per cycle
- 0.5% price appreciation per cycle
- **Expected Return**: 1.5-2.0% monthly (18-24% annualized)

### Moderate Case
- 3 cycles per month
- $0.45-0.55 avg dividend per cycle  
- 0.8% price appreciation per cycle
- **Expected Return**: 3-4% monthly (36-48% annualized)

### Aggressive Case
- 3-4 cycles per month
- $0.50+ avg dividend per cycle
- 1.0-1.5% price appreciation per cycle
- **Expected Return**: 5-8% monthly (60-96% annualized)

## QUICK MATH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: JEPI $58 entry
```
Buy: 86 shares @ $58/share = $4,988
Dividend: 86 × $0.35 = $30
Sell: 86 @ $58.50 = $5,031
Profit: ($5,031 + $30) - $4,988 = $73
Return: 1.46% over 3 days = 177% annualized
```

### Example 2: XYLD $42.50 entry  
```
Buy: 129 shares @ $42.50 = $5,482
Dividend: 129 × $0.32 = $41
Sell: 129 @ $43.00 = $5,547
Profit: ($5,547 + $41) - $5,482 = $106
Return: 1.93% over 3 days = 235% annualized
```

### Example 3: SDIV $14.30 entry
```
Buy: 384 shares @ $14.30 = $5,491
Dividend: 384 × $0.12 = $46
Sell: 384 @ $14.45 = $5,549
Profit: ($5,549 + $46) - $5,491 = $104
Return: 1.89% over 3 days = 230% annualized
```
