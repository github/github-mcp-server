## YOUR NEW PATH: SECURED GAINS & RELIABLE DIVIDENDS

This plan is designed to be **better** by prioritizing what matters most for long-term wealth creation: **security of principal and reliable, growing income.** It directly addresses the risks of the "Active Trader" plan by focusing on a time-tested, lower-effort strategy.

**What makes this plan better and more secure?**
- **Reduced Risk:** We are abandoning the high-risk dividend capture strategy. Instead, we will buy and hold high-quality assets, dramatically reducing the risk of capital loss.
- **Less Effort, More Life:** Your time commitment drops from 20+ hours a month to just 1-2 hours for periodic monitoring. No more daily trading.
- **Focus on Total Return:** This strategy aims for both dividend income AND capital growth, leading to a more secure and powerful compounding effect over time.
- **Simplicity:** With only a handful of trades per year (instead of 116+), the strategy is easier to execute, and tax reporting is vastly simplified.

## THE CORE-SATELLITE PORTFOLIO ($200,000)

We will structure the portfolio into two parts: a large, stable "Core" for security and a smaller, high-yield "Satellite" to boost income.

### **1. CORE HOLDINGS (70% of Portfolio - $140,000)**
**Purpose:** The foundation of your portfolio. These are high-quality, dividend-growing ETFs designed for stability and long-term capital appreciation.

```
1. SCHD - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
   Allocation: $40,000
   Yield: ~3.8%
   Role: Tracks high-quality, financially strong US dividend stocks. The gold standard for dividend investors.

2. DGRO - iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF
   Allocation: $40,000
   Yield: ~2.5%
   Role: Focuses on companies with a consistent history of growing their dividends. A key driver of future income growth.

3. VIG - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF
   Allocation: $30,000
   Yield: ~1.8%
   Role: The ultimate in dividend security, tracking companies that have increased dividends for 10+ consecutive years.

4. VYM - Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF
   Allocation: $30,000
   Yield: ~3.2%
   Role: Provides exposure to a broad basket of higher-yielding US stocks, balancing growth with current income.
```

### **2. SATELLITE HOLDINGS (30% of Portfolio - $60,000)**
**Purpose:** To enhance the portfolio's overall yield. This portion is more income-focused but is small enough that it doesn't compromise the security of the overall plan.

```
5. JEPI - JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF
   Allocation: $30,000
   Yield: ~7.3%
   Role: An actively managed fund that provides high monthly income with lower volatility than traditional covered call ETFs. A perfect bridge between the Core and Satellite.

6. O - Realty Income
   Allocation: $15,000
   Yield: ~5.8%
   Role: A "blue-chip" REIT that pays monthly dividends. Adds real estate diversification and a reliable income stream.

7. QYLD - Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF
   Allocation: $15,000
   Yield: ~11.9%
   Role: This is our pure high-yield play. Its small allocation provides a significant income boost without exposing the entire portfolio to the volatility of covered call strategies.

## PROJECTED ANNUAL PERFORMANCE

This plan focuses on **Total Return**, which is the combination of dividend income and capital growth.

### **1. Annual Dividend Income Projection**
```
CORE DIVIDENDS:
SCHD:  $40,000 × 3.8% = $1,520
DGRO:  $40,000 × 2.5% = $1,000
VIG:   $30,000 × 1.8% = $540
VYM:   $30,000 × 3.2% = $960
Core Subtotal: $4,020

SATELLITE DIVIDENDS:
JEPI:  $30,000 × 7.3%  = $2,190
O:     $15,000 × 5.8%  = $870
QYLD:  $15,000 × 11.9% = $1,785
Satellite Subtotal: $4,845

═══════════════════════════════════════════
TOTAL ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCOME: $8,865
(Yield on Cost: 4.43%)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```
*This income is substantially more secure and likely to grow year-over-year, unlike the income from the previous plan.*

### **2. Projected Capital Growth**
A conservative estimate for annual capital growth on the core holdings is 7-9%.
```
Core Holdings Growth: $140,000 × 8% = $11,200
Satellite Holdings Growth (estimated): $1,000 - $1,500 (JEPI and O provide modest growth)

TOTAL ANNUAL CAPITAL GROWTH: ~$12,500
```

### **3. Projected Total Return (Net)**
```
Total Dividends:      $8,865
Total Capital Growth: $12,500
---------------------------------
GROSS TOTAL RETURN:   $21,365

Tax Drag (Qualified Dividends & Long-Term Gains @ 15%): -$2,500 (approx.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════
NET ANNUAL RETURN: ~$18,865

RETURN ON $200,000: 9.4%
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```
While the 9.4% target is lower than the aggressive 17.5% target, it is **vastly more secure and achievable.**

---

## PLAN EXECUTION: SIMPLE & EFFICIENT

**1. Initial Setup (1-2 hours):**
   - Buy the 7 positions according to their specified allocations.
   - Use limit orders to ensure good entry prices.
   - **That's it. Your portfolio is now working for you.**

**2. Ongoing Management (1-2 hours per QUARTER):**
   - **Reinvest Dividends:** Set all dividends to automatically reinvest (DRIP). This is the key to compounding and wealth generation.
   - **Review & Rebalance:** Once per quarter, check your allocations. If any position has grown or shrunk significantly (e.g., by more than 5% from its target), sell a small amount of the overweight positions and buy the underweight ones to return to your 70/30 Core/Satellite split.

| **Tax Complexity**        | Extreme (Short-term gains)     | **Simple (Long-term gains)**             |

## CONCLUSION: A TRULY BETTER PATH

This **Dividend Compounding & Security Plan** delivers on your request for a "better" strategy.

While the "Active Trader" plan offered the *possibility* of higher returns, it came with an unacceptable level of risk, effort, and stress. This new plan provides a robust, reliable, and sustainable path to building wealth. It gives you strong dividend income and the peace of mind that comes from a secure, steadily growing portfolio.

This is the smarter way to invest for the long term.
