## MARKET CONTEXT

### Current Gold Prices (2025-11-27):
- **XAUUSD (Spot):** ~$4,165/oz = ~$134/gram
- **USD/CNY Exchange Rate:** ~7.25 (estimate)
- **Estimated Shanghai Gold Spot:** ~970 CNY/gram

### Critical Assumptions:
**NOTE:** Please verify the following:
1. Are strikes in CNY/gram or CNY/contract?
2. What is current 沪金2604 futures price?
3. What is current 沪金2602 futures price?
4. Contract multiplier (typically 1000g = 1kg)

**Assuming strikes are CNY/gram:**
- C960: Near the money / Slightly OTM
- C1000: Out of the money (~3% OTM)

---

## STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### Position 1: 沪金2604 C960 (Nearest Expiry)
**Profile:** SHORT-TERM MOMENTUM PLAY
- **Moneyness:** At-the-money or near-the-money
- **Time Decay:** HIGH (60 days, theta accelerating)
- **Risk:** High time decay, needs quick move up
- **Reward:** Lower strike = higher delta, faster gains if gold rallies

**Breakeven:** 960 + 49.61 = 1009.61 CNY/gram
**Max Loss:** 49.61 CNY per gram (49,610 CNY per contract)
**Max Gain:** Unlimited above breakeven

### Position 2 & 3: C1000 Calls (Same Strike, Different Contracts)
**Profile:** MEDIUM-TERM SPECULATION
- **Moneyness:** Out of the money (~3% OTM)
- **Time Decay:** MODERATE (118 days remaining)
- **Cost Difference:** 36.82 vs 27.23 = 9.59 CNY premium difference

**Why is 2604 C1000 more expensive than 2602 C1000?**
- Later contract month (June vs Feb) may have higher forward pricing
- OR different implied volatility
- OR current 2604 futures price > 2602 futures price

**Breakeven:**
- Position 2: 1000 + 36.82 = 1036.82 CNY/gram
- Position 3: 1000 + 27.23 = 1027.23 CNY/gram

## CRITICAL WARNINGS

### Time Decay Risk:
⚠️ **OPTIONS LOSE VALUE EVERY DAY THEY ARE HELD**
- This is NOT a buy-and-hold strategy
- Time decay accelerates in final 30 days
- Position 1 has HIGHEST time decay risk
- Must actively manage or accept 100% loss

### Leverage Risk:
⚠️ **OPTIONS CAN GO TO ZERO**
- Maximum loss: 100% of premium paid
- No margin calls, but total loss possible
- Do NOT add to losing positions
- Do NOT treat like stock positions

### Liquidity Risk:
⚠️ **Shanghai Gold Options May Have Low Liquidity**
- Check bid-ask spreads daily
- May not be able to exit at desired price
- Consider this when setting profit targets
- Use limit orders, not market orders

### Currency Risk:
⚠️ **CNY Exchange Rate Affects Returns**
- If USD strengthens, gold in CNY may not rise as much
- Monitor USD/CNY for correlation breaks
- Shanghai gold premium to international can vary

---

## ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES (If Needed)

### If Wanting to Reduce Risk:
1. **Sell Position 2 or 3:** Keep only one C1000 position
2. **Roll Down:** If gold rallies to 1000, roll to lower strikes
3. **Spread:** Sell higher strike calls to create bull call spread (reduces cost)

### If Wanting to Add Risk:
1. **Only if gold breaks above 990 convincingly**
2. **Add June 2026 C1000 calls on pullbacks**
3. **Never add to losing positions**

### If Wanting to Hedge:
1. **Buy puts:** Consider C940 puts if gold rallies to 1000+
2. **Collar:** Sell C1020 calls to finance put purchases
3. **Stop loss:** Simplest and recommended for option buyers

4. Strict stop loss discipline required

**Recommended Focus:**
