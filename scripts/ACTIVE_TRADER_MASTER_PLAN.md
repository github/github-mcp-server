## CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### Position Sizing for 8 Monthly ETFs

**Available Capital:** $200,000

**Strategy:** Stagger trades to maximize capital efficiency

#### Option A: Sequential Trading (Lower Risk)
```
Week 1: Deploy $66,000 (2 ETFs × $33,000 each)
Week 2: Week 1 capital returns, deploy $66,000 (2 different ETFs)
Week 3: Week 2 capital returns, deploy $66,000 (2 different ETFs)
Week 4: Week 3 capital returns, deploy $66,000 (2 different ETFs)

Peak Capital Deployed: $66,000 (33%)
Idle Cash: ~$134,000 available for opportunities
```

#### Option B: Parallel Trading (Higher Risk, Higher Return)
```
Week 1-2: Deploy $132,000 (4 ETFs × $33,000 each)
Week 2-3: Deploy $132,000 (4 different ETFs while first 2 exit)
Week 3-4: Continuous rotation

Peak Capital Deployed: $132,000 (66%)
Idle Cash: $68,000 reserve
```

#### **RECOMMENDED: Option A for First 6 Months**
- Lower risk of being fully deployed during market crash
- Easier to manage psychologically
- Cash available for opportunistic trades

## ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT

### Position-Specific Rules

**For ALL Positions:**
1. **Stop-loss:** -2% from entry price
2. **Hold period:** Maximum 5 trading days
3. **Entry:** Limit orders only (no market orders on entry)
4. **Exit:** Market orders acceptable 1 day after ex-date

**For SVOL (High Risk):**
1. **Position size:** 50% of normal ($33k vs. $66k)
2. **Tighter stop-loss:** -1.5%
3. **Monitor VIX:** If VIX > 30, skip SVOL trades
4. **Dividend verification:** Check monthly distribution amount (varies)

**For All Covered Call ETFs (XYLD, QYLD, RYLD, DJIA):**
1. **Bull market risk:** These lag in strong rallies
2. **If S&P up >2% in a week:** Consider reducing position sizes
3. **Monitor option premiums:** Dividends vary with volatility

### Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

**Maximum Exposure:**
- Never exceed $132,000 deployed (66% of capital)
- Always maintain $68,000 cash reserve (34%)
- Use reserve for quarterly ETF trades or emergencies

**Correlation Warning:**
- 7 of 8 monthly ETFs use covered call strategy
- All suffer if option premiums collapse
- **Diversification:** Quarterly ETFs don't use covered calls

**Market Crash Protocol:**
- If S&P drops >5% in one week:
  - Exit all current positions immediately
  - Skip next 1-2 weeks of monthly trades
  - Reassess when markets stabilize
  - Use cash to buy quarterly ETFs at discount

## TAX OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### The Tax Problem

With 116 trades/year, you'll have:
- **116 short-term capital gains/losses** (taxed as ordinary income)
- **$50,156 in dividend income** (non-qualified, ordinary income)
- **Estimated tax liability:** $11,664 at 25% rate, $15,047 at 30% rate

### Solutions

#### 1. **Use IRA/Roth IRA (BEST OPTION)**
```
If you run this in Roth IRA:
- Gross return: 23.3% ($46,656)
- Tax drag: $0
- Net return: 23.3%
- vs. Taxable: 17.5%
- TAX SAVINGS: $11,664/year

If you run in Traditional IRA:
- Tax deferred until retirement
- Potentially lower bracket at withdrawal
- Still better than taxable account
```

#### 2. **Harvest Losses Strategically**
```
- Some trades will lose money (17% based on backtest)
- Use losses to offset gains
- Carry forward unused losses
- Reduces taxable income
```

#### 3. **Separate Accounts**
```
Account 1: Monthly ETFs (active trading) → IRA/Roth
Account 2: Quarterly ETFs → Taxable (lower turnover)
Account 3: Buy-hold S&P 500 → Taxable (long-term gains)

Optimize tax efficiency across accounts
```

#### 4. **Professional Tax Help**
```
Cost: $500-$1,500/year for CPA
Benefit: Proper categorization, loss harvesting, strategy
ROI: Could save $2,000-$5,000 in taxes
Worth it: ABSOLUTELY for 116 trades/year
```

## SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

### Must-Track Metrics

**1. Win Rate (Target: 75-83%)**
```
Winning trades ÷ Total trades
Below 70%: Something wrong, review strategy
75-80%: Good, on track
Above 83%: Excellent, beating backtest
```

**2. Average P&L Per Trade (Target: $150-$250)**
```
Total P&L ÷ Total trades
Include both dividend and price gains/losses
Aim for $200 average = $23,200 annual on 116 trades
```

**3. Dividend Capture Rate (Target: 95%+)**
```
Actual dividends received ÷ Expected dividends
Should be 98-100% if executed correctly
Missing dividends = execution error
```

**4. Time Efficiency (Target: <15 min per trade)**
```
Total time ÷ Total trades
Goal: 116 trades × 15 min = 29 hours/year
Realistic with tools: 20-25 hours/month
```

**5. Slippage (Target: <0.3% per trade)**
```
(Entry price - target price) + (Exit price - target price)
Monitor both entry and exit slippage
High slippage = need better execution
