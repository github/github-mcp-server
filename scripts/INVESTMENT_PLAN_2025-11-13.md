## CAPITAL ALLOCATION PLAN

### Available Capital: $200,000

**Conservative Approach (Recommended for Start):**
- Use 33% per dividend cycle = $66,000
- Split among 2-3 positions = $22,000-$33,000 each
- Keep $134,000 in reserve for next opportunities
- Can execute 3 complete cycles per month with monthly payers

**Aggressive Approach (After 3 Months Experience):**
- Use 50% per dividend cycle = $100,000
- Split among 3-4 positions = $25,000-$33,000 each
- Can execute up to 5-6 trades per month

---

## EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### Before Each Trade:
1. ✅ Verify exact ex-dividend date from company/broker
2. ✅ Confirm you'll be shareholder of record on ex-date
3. ✅ Check trading hours - buy by market close 2 days before
4. ✅ Set limit orders to control entry price
5. ✅ Calculate exact position size (33% ÷ number of concurrent positions)

### On Ex-Dividend Date:
1. ✅ Verify dividend credit in account
2. ✅ Hold position through ex-date (don't sell)
3. ✅ Monitor price for post-dividend drop

### After Ex-Dividend Date:
1. ✅ Sell position 1 trading day after ex-date
2. ✅ Use limit orders or market open sell
3. ✅ Record trade results (entry, exit, dividend, P&L)
4. ✅ Prepare capital for next opportunity

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Position Sizing Rules:
- **Maximum per position:** 33% of total capital
- **Maximum concurrent positions:** 3-4
- **Stop loss:** -2% on position (if price drops before ex-date)
- **Hold discipline:** Never hold more than 5 trading days

### Market Risk Considerations:
- **Ex-dividend price drop:** Stocks typically drop by dividend amount on ex-date
- **Capital gains impact:** Short-term capital gains tax on price appreciation
- **Dividend tax:** Qualified dividends taxed at lower rate (need 60-day hold)
- **Market volatility:** Strategy works best in stable/rising markets

### Tax Planning:
- **Short-term gains:** Taxed as ordinary income (your tax rate)
- **Dividend income:** May not qualify for preferential rate (short hold period)
- **Record keeping:** Track all trades for tax reporting
- **Consult CPA:** For tax-efficient implementation

---

## EXPECTED RETURNS (Conservative Estimates)

### Per Trade Assumptions:
- **Dividend yield:** 0.5-0.8% per trade (3-4 day hold)
- **Price risk:** ±1% volatility during hold
- **Win rate:** 83% (based on backtest)
- **Net return per trade:** 0.3-0.5% after costs

### Monthly Projections:
- **Trades per month:** 4-6 (with monthly payers)
- **Capital per trade:** $66,000
- **Return per trade:** $198-$330 (0.3-0.5%)
- **Monthly return:** $800-$2,000 (0.4-1.0% on total capital)
- **Annual return:** $9,600-$24,000 (4.8-12% on $200k)

### Reality Check:
- Backtest showed 0.63% over 2 years = 0.315% annually
- This was with automated execution and no slippage
- Real-world expect: **2-5% annually** after costs and taxes
- **Risk-adjusted:** Better than money market, lower than S&P 500
