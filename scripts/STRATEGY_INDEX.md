## 📈 The Numbers

### Backtest Results (Aug 1 - Nov 11, 2024)

- **Profitable Trades**: 2 (SDIV.US, XYLD.US)
- **Win Rate**: 66.7%

### Monthly Projection (Moderate Scenario)
```
Starting Capital:        $50,000
Capital Per Cycle:       ~$5,500 per ETF × 3
Cycles Per Month:        3
Dividend Income:         $0.45 avg × 3 ETFs × ~350 shares × 3 = $1,417
Capital Gains:           0.8% × $50,000 × 3 = $1,200
Gross Monthly Profit:    ~$2,617
Net (after fees):        ~$2,437
Monthly Return:          4.9%
Annual Return (est.):    58.8%
```

⚠️ **Reality Check**: These are optimistic numbers. Conservative estimate: 1.5-2% monthly is more realistic.

## ⚠️ Risk Management Rules

**DO's:**
✅ Execute buy/sell orders at market open  
✅ Set strict position size limits ($10K max)  
✅ Document every trade  
✅ Monitor dividend announcements  
✅ Use limit orders to control slippage  
✅ Take profits on schedule (don't hold longer)  

**DON'Ts:**
❌ Don't try to time the market  
❌ Don't deviate from position sizing  
❌ Don't hold positions longer than plan  
❌ Don't ignore dividend cuts  
❌ Don't use leverage/margin  
❌ Don't panic sell on volatility  

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "The dividend amount is less than I expected"
→ Adjust position size down for that ETF going forward  
→ Monitor for dividend cut announcements

### "The price dropped >2% on ex-date"
→ Exit with predetermined stop-loss  
→ Skip this ETF for next cycle if pattern repeats

### "I can't get the buy order filled"
→ Use a limit order at 0.25% below the ask  
→ Or skip to next dividend event and try again

### "My broker won't execute rapid trades"
→ Choose a low-cost broker (TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers)  
→ Ensure you have sufficient day trading buying power

### "I missed the ex-date"
→ Don't try to catch fallen knife, wait for next cycle  
→ 16 events identified in next 90 days - plenty of opportunities
