                           STRATEGY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CORE CONCEPT:
    Buy 2 days before ex-dividend date
    → Hold through dividend payment
    → Sell 1 day after ex-dividend date
    → Repeat every 7-10 days

THE 3 SELECTED ETFs:
    ✓ JEPI (Janus Henderson Equity Premium Income) - 7.2% dividend
    ✓ XYLD (Global X S&P 500 Covered Call) - 8.3% dividend
    ✓ SDIV (Global X SuperDividend U.S.) - 8.9% dividend

EXPECTED RETURNS:
    Conservative: 1.5-2.0% monthly (18-24% annualized)
    Moderate:     3-4% monthly (36-48% annualized)
    Aggressive:   5-8% monthly (60-96% annualized)

RISK PROFILE:
    - Low market risk (3-5 day holding periods)
    - Moderate dividend cut risk
    - Low liquidity risk (high-volume ETFs)
    - Manageable with position sizing limits

================================================================================
                         BACKTEST RESULTS
================================================================================

================================================================================
                         FORWARD PLAN
================================================================================

Identified Events: 16 dividend payments (next 90 days)
Projected Cycles: 10-12 complete buy/sell cycles
Primary Tickers: JEPI, XYLD, SDIV
Secondary Tickers: SCHD, VYM, HDV, DGRO, NOBL

Upcoming Actions (This Month):
  - NOBL.US: Ex-date December 10 → Buy Dec 8, Sell Dec 11 ($0.58)
  - Monitor for other available opportunities

Monthly Execution Frequency:
  - Moderate scenario: 3 cycles per month
  - Expected dividend income: $1,200-$1,500
  - Expected capital gains: $800-$1,200
  - Net monthly profit target: $2,000-$2,700

================================================================================
                        POSITION SIZING & ALLOCATION
================================================================================

Formula:
  Allocation Per Event = Total Cash × 0.33 (per dividend opportunity)
  Shares to Buy = Allocation / Current Market Price
  Max Position Size = $10,000 per trade
  Min Position Size = $500 per trade

Example with $50,000 Capital:
  - Event allocation: $50,000 × 0.33 = $16,500
  - Per ticker: $16,500 / 3 = $5,500 each
  - At $42.50/share: Buy ~129 shares
  - Dividend income: 129 × $0.32 = $41.28
  - Capital gains: ~$64.50
  - Total profit per cycle: ~$105.78 (1.93% return in 3 days)

Capital Velocity:
  - ~$16,500 deployed every 7-10 days
  - Proceeds + dividends recycled to next opportunity
  - Rolling allocation model maximizes deployment frequency

================================================================================
                       MONTHLY PERFORMANCE TARGETS
================================================================================

Conservative Case (Most Realistic):
  Cycles per month: 2-3
  Monthly return: 1.5-2.0%
  Annualized return: 18-24%

Moderate Case (Target):
  Cycles per month: 3
  Monthly return: 3-4%
  Annualized return: 36-48%

Aggressive Case (Optimistic):
  Cycles per month: 3-4
  Monthly return: 5-8%
  Annualized return: 60-96%

⚠️ REALITY CHECK:
  Conservative 1.5-2% monthly is most sustainable
  Avoid over-optimistic expectations of 5-8% monthly
  Factor in dividend cuts, tax impacts, trading costs

================================================================================
                        RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

Position Limits:
  ✓ Max $10,000 per individual position
  ✓ Max $15,000 per ticker
  ✓ Min $500 per position (transaction efficiency)
  ✓ No leverage/margin
  ✓ 10% cash reserve minimum

Stop-Loss Rules:
  - Price gap down >2% on ex-date: Exit immediately
  - Dividend cut >20%: Reduce position by 20-30%
  - Volume drop >50%: Scale down or skip
  - Correlation >0.8 to holdings: Diversify

Weekly Monitoring:
  ✓ Check dividend announcements
  ✓ Monitor ETF prices vs. entry points
  ✓ Review P&L for completed trades
  ✓ Verify dividend payments
  ✓ Update ex-date calendar

Monthly Review:
  ✓ Analyze performance vs. benchmark

  ✓ Tax loss harvest if applicable
  ✓ Adjust parameters based on results

================================================================================
                          DAILY WORKFLOW
================================================================================

3 Days Before Ex-Dividend Date:
  1. Identify upcoming ex-date
  2. Calculate position size
  3. Set buy order for 2 days before

On Buy Day:
  1. Execute buy order at market open
  2. Confirm shares received
  3. Set calendar reminder for sell date

Day After Ex-Dividend Date (Sell Day):
  1. Execute sell order at market open
  2. Target sell price: +0.5% to +1.0% above entry
  3. Confirm proceeds
  4. Wait for dividend settlement (2-3 days)

Calculate Profit:
  Profit = (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Shares + Dividend Income
  
  Example: ($43.10 - $42.50) × 200 + $64 = $184 per $8,500 = 2.2%

Recycle Capital:
  Proceeds + dividends → Capital pool for next cycle
