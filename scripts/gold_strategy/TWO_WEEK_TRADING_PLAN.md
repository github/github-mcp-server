## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Position Limits

| Risk Level | Max Allocation | Max Contracts |

| Conservative | 3% of portfolio | 1 contract |
| Moderate | 5% of portfolio | 2 contracts |
| Aggressive | 10% of portfolio | 4 contracts |

### Stop Loss Rules

1. **Hard Stop:** Close if loss exceeds 50% of premium paid
   - Bull Call Spread: Exit if net value < ¥10.46/g

2. **Time Stop:** Close position on Nov 29 if not in profit
   - Avoid holding through final weekend before expiry

3. **Volatility Stop:** Close if IV spikes >30% (currently 19.67%)
   - High IV = expensive to exit

### Profit Taking

| Target | Action |

| 70% of max profit | Scale out another 1/3 |
| 90% of max profit | Close remaining |
