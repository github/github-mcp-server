## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Before Your First Trade
1. **Start Small** - Use minimum position size first
2. **Test Everything** - Verify broker platform, order execution
3. **Track Carefully** - Record every trade detail
4. **Watch One Cycle** - See full 3-5 day process before scaling

### During Trading
5. **Don't Deviate** - Stick to generated plan and exit dates
6. **Monitor Daily** - 30-60 min daily commitment essential
7. **Log Everything** - Spreadsheet with dates, prices, results
8. **Stay Disciplined** - Hit stop-losses, don't hope for recovery

### After Each Trade
9. **Calculate P&L** - Know exactly what you made/lost
10. **Learn from Each** - What went right? What could improve?
11. **Optimize Gradually** - Change one variable at a time
12. **Scale Methodically** - Increase capital as confidence grows

---

## 🚨 Critical Risk Reminders

### You MUST Do:
```
✅ Set -2% stop-loss orders IMMEDIATELY after buying
✅ Monitor daily (dividends can be cut, prices can gap)
✅ Keep position sizes ≤ 10% of capital
✅ Diversify across multiple stocks/ETFs
✅ Track all trades in a spreadsheet
✅ Rebalance if any position grows > 15%
```

### You MUST NOT Do:
```
❌ Use leverage or margin (too risky)
❌ Hope for recovery (cut losses at -2%)
❌ Concentrate all capital in one stock
❌ Ignore dividend announcements
❌ Miss your planned exit date
❌ Trade without documented plan
❌ Assume past yields will continue
```
