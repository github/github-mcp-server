# Insiders Features

Insiders Mode gives you access to experimental features in the GitHub MCP Server. These features may change, evolve, or be removed based on community feedback.

We created this mode to have a way to roll out experimental features and collect feedback. So if you are using Insiders, please don't hesitate to share your feedback with us! 

> [!NOTE]
> Features in Insiders Mode are experimental.

## Enabling Insiders Mode

| Method | Remote Server | Local Server |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| URL path | Append `/insiders` to the URL | N/A |
| Header | `X-MCP-Insiders: true` | N/A |
| CLI flag | N/A | `--insiders` |
| Environment variable | N/A | `GITHUB_INSIDERS=true` |

For configuration examples, see the [Server Configuration Guide](./server-configuration.md#insiders-mode).

_There are currently no insiders-only features. [MCP Apps](./server-configuration.md#mcp-apps) has graduated to a feature flag (`remote_mcp_ui_apps`) and can be enabled independently._
