## Remote GitHub MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D&quality=insiders)

The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

<table>
<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>
<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

</td>

    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com`:
```
{
    ...
    "proxima-github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}"
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**
   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT

   # In config files (where supported)
   "env": {
     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_PAT"
   }
   ```

> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

</details>

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.
``` json
"github": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_HOST",
    "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",
        "GITHUB_HOST": "https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>"
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "github_token",
        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [

      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

> **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with toolsets.

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

#### Specifying Individual Tools

You can also configure specific tools using the `--tools` flag. Tools can be used independently or combined with toolsets and dynamic toolsets discovery for fine-grained control.

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLS="get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Combining with Toolsets** (additive):
   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues --tools get_gist
   ```
   This registers all tools from `repos` and `issues` toolsets, plus `get_gist`.

4. **Combining with Dynamic Toolsets** (additive):
   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --tools get_file_contents --dynamic-toolsets
   ```
   This registers `get_file_contents` plus the dynamic toolset tools (`enable_toolset`, `list_available_toolsets`, `get_toolset_tools`).

**Important Notes:**
- Tools, toolsets, and dynamic toolsets can all be used together
- Read-only mode takes priority: write tools are skipped if `--read-only` is set, even if explicitly requested via `--tools`
- Tool names must match exactly (e.g., `get_file_contents`, not `getFileContents`). Invalid tool names will cause the server to fail at startup with an error message

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Using Tools With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass specific tools as environment variables. You can also combine tools with toolsets:

```bash
# Tools only
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS="get_file_contents,issue_read,create_pull_request" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# Tools combined with toolsets (additive)
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues" \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLS="get_gist" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Special toolsets

#### "all" toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

Or using the environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="all" ./github-mcp-server
```

#### "default" toolset
The default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.

The default configuration is:
- context
- repos
- issues
- pull_requests
- users

To keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="default,stargazers" ./github-mcp-server
```

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available:

## Dynamic Tool Discovery

**Note**: This feature is currently in beta and is not available in the Remote GitHub MCP Server. Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.

Instead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.

### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery

When using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets
```

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## Read-Only Mode

To run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --read-only
```

When using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## Lockdown Mode

Lockdown mode limits the content that the server will surface from public repositories. When enabled, the server checks whether the author of each item has push access to the repository. Private repositories are unaffected, and collaborators keep full access to their own content.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --lockdown-mode
```

When running with Docker, set the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_LOCKDOWN_MODE=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

The behavior of lockdown mode depends on the tool invoked.

Following tools will return an error when the author lacks the push access:

- `issue_read:get`
- `pull_request_read:get`

Following tools will filter out content from users lacking the push access:

- `issue_read:get_comments`
- `issue_read:get_sub_issues`
- `pull_request_read:get_comments`
- `pull_request_read:get_review_comments`
- `pull_request_read:get_reviews`

## i18n / Overriding Descriptions

The descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a
`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.

The file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new
descriptions as values. For example:

```json
{
  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "an alternative description",
  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a GitHub repository"
}
```

You can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with
the `--export-translations` flag.

This flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding
any new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you
exported.

```sh
./github-mcp-server --export-translations
cat github-mcp-server-config.json
```

You can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment
variable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with
`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.

For example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can
set the following environment variable:

```sh
export GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="an alternative description"
```

## Library Usage

The exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.
